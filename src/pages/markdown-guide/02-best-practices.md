# Best Practices

## Document Structure

Organize your documentation with a clear hierarchy:

```markdown
# Document Title (H1)

Brief introduction...

## Main Section (H2 - creates new page)

Section introduction...

### Subsection (H3 - appears in sidebar)

Detailed content...

#### Sub-subsection (H4 - appears in sidebar if expandAllSections: true)

Even more detail...
```

## Writing Tips

### Keep Headings Descriptive
Use clear, concise heading text that describes the content.

### Use H2 for main sections
These become separate pages in QuickDoc.

### Add blank lines
Separate different elements with blank lines for readability.

❌ Bad:
```markdown
## Heading
Paragraph text
- List item
```

✅ Good:
```markdown
## Heading

Paragraph text

- List item
```

## Content Guidelines

### Start with H1
Every document should have exactly one H1 heading at the top.

### Use H2 for main sections
These become separate pages in QuickDoc.

### Keep headings descriptive
Use clear, concise heading text that describes the content.

### Add blank lines
Separate different elements with blank lines for readability.
