```

## Tables

Create tables using pipes:

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     | More     |
| Row 2    | Data     | More     |
```

### Table Alignment

```markdown
| Left | Center | Right |
|:-----|:------:|------:|
| Text | Text   | Text  |
```

## Blockquotes

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.
>
> > Nested blockquotes are also possible.
```

## Horizontal Rules

Create dividers with three or more dashes:

```markdown
---
```

## HTML Support

You can use HTML when Markdown isn't enough:

```html
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
Hidden content here.
</details>
```

**Note**: Use HTML sparingly. Stick to Markdown when possible for better readability.
