# V0.2.3

## Bug Fixes

### Mobile Layout
- **Fixed mobile sidebar overlay behavior** - Sidebar now properly acts as an overlay drawer on mobile instead of taking up space in the layout
- **Improved desktop layout consistency** - Sidebar correctly participates in flex layout on desktop while remaining as overlay on mobile
- **Enhanced responsive positioning** - Fixed conflicting CSS classes that caused layout issues across different screen sizes

### Search Navigation
- **Fixed search result URLs for sections** - Search results now generate correct anchor links (`/file#section`) instead of incorrect path segments (`/file/section`)
- **Eliminated 404 errors** - Clicking search results for document sections now navigates properly without causing "Section Not Found" errors
- **Improved URL consistency** - All section navigation now follows the same URL pattern across the application
