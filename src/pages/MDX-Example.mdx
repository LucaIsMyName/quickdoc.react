## Features

MDX allows you to:

- Write standard Markdown content
- Embed React components directly
- Create interactive documentation
- Use JSX syntax

## Code Example

You can still use regular code blocks:

### Javascript

```typescript
const greeting = (name: string) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greeting('World'));
```
## Conclusion

With MDX support, you can create rich, interactive documentation that goes beyond static markdown. This opens up possibilities for:

- Live code examples
- Interactive tutorials
- Custom UI components
- Data visualizations
- And much more!
